### Hi üëã
<!-- HEY YOU!!! WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT SRCCCC -->
I program stuff. 
Pretty much anything from front end, to software or game development


#### Unpopular opinions
- Using Typescript over Javascript is always a preference for me when using Web related things. (i also like to incorporate WASM as much as possible where applicable)
- Using compiled languages for backends should be a standard. (go, rust)
- Using c# over java should be a standard 
- Game cheating should primarily be done in c++, with c# being an exception for external usages.
- You shouldn't really use python for anything which isn't data related or machine learning. (yes i am negatively biased towards python)

#### About me
Im a programmer from britain. I primarily work with web related stuff but i know pretty much everything else. Im currently interested in game "cheating" and i have been doing things with it. I used to work for PSU and i made and developed some things which are being used in real world practice, for example their discord bot, or their api. I worked on their obfuscator although not as much as the other two where i build them from scratch.

#### Contact
You can find methods to contact me @ https://astolfo.uk/contact
Or if you want to contact me through discord you can via [clicking here](https://discordapp.com/users/644348720263200769/)
the discord account is an older account, do not expect a response and currently the website is down, i can't be bothered paying for hosting when it's pretty much useless atm.
and if i have a main website i want it to be actually interesting, and i just haven't had any ideas yet. 

#### Why are your commits terrible and good?
Because I forget to run git push

#### Technologies i like
- Currently i've been very interested in rust and packages which come with it, for example rocket which is a http server
- I also like some frontend / web development utilties, for example tailwind css which makes css not horrendous to work with
- Working with ORM's is pretty much a standard for me, i don't really like writing raw sql since im pretty bad at it, and ORM's just simplify the entire process even if the queries suck.

#### Languages im using at the moment
- **Rust** - really fast and easy to use while still being compiled and can be compiled to WASM really easily giving it even more usage in frontend development where speed is really necessary and you're unable to get the performance in js.
- **Typescript** - Javascript with types, just infinitely better than standalone javascript as it gives insight into errors which you will encounter before runtime which is a life safer and has entirely changed my workflow with javascript making it more sane. It can also be transpiled into older versions of javascript albeit IE is pretty much never used now and most browsers are chromium.
- **C#** - I like working with c# for more connected or desktop-like applications as it's just really nice and easy to use, the tools for this language are amazing and just make the expirence of using it so much better.
- **C++** - I Don't really use c++ that much as i will usually use rust or C# more, but the undisputed place where i always use c++ is memory cheating as it's just way easier to do in c++ especially for internal cheats.

   <summary>The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.</summary>
   The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can‚Äôt predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.
