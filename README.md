### Hi ðŸ‘‹
<!-- HEY YOU!!! WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT SRCCCC -->
I like to program websites (front and back), applications, and i enjoy working low level (memory manipulation).
#### My favourite own projects:
- [`mci`](https://github.com/pozm/mci) - The ability to interact with minecraft through rust using JNI. Mci will make everything easy on the developer just allowing them to write the code to interact without having to worry about the caviats with JNI. Mci can automatically generate defs for every minecraft class, field, method and arguments.
- [`gdke`](https://github.com/pozm/gdke) | [`godot-key-extract`](https://github.com/pozm/godot-key-extract) - allows you to retrieve godot encryption keys without the hassle of reverse engineering. all you need to do is run the executable or inject the dll and you will easily retrieve the key.
- [`poggers`](https://github.com/pozm/poggers) - Provides an easy to use api to access memory of other applications. This is mostly used to game cheat but can also be used for game modding and various other things, for example gdke uses it!
