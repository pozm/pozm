### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I plan to do freelance programming soon as I have experience with many languages and fun to program. I was the former CTO at PSU; while I was at PSU, I worked on real-world applications, such as their Obfuscator, bot, and API.

I focus mainly on web development, although I am able to accomplish tasks that require a different skill-set (software development)

I've worked previously on a multitude of projects which can be found in here, in my github.

I am able to work in a time sensitive, stressful environment as-well as communicate to other project members effectively.
