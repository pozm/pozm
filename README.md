### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I program stuff. 
Pretty much anything from front end, to software or game development


#### Unpopular opinions
- Using Typescript over Javascript is always a preference for me when using Web related things.
- Using go for backends should be a standard.
- Using c# over java should be a standard
- Doing game cheating or similar should only be done in c++, not c# or some other stuff unless the game doesn't compile to asm.
- You shouldn't really use python for anything which isn't data related or machine learning.

#### About me
Im a programmer from britain. I primarily work with web related stuff but i know pretty much everything else. Im currently interested in game "cheating" and i have been doing things with it. I used to work for PSU and i made and developed some things which are being used in real world practice, for example their discord bot, or their api. I worked on their obfuscator although not as much as the other two where i build them from scratch. Im currently working on a backend for an undisclosed company. 
<!---

I plan to do freelance programming soon as I have experience with many languages and fun to program. I was the former CTO at PSU; while I was at PSU, I worked on real-world applications, such as their Obfuscator, bot, and API.

I focus mainly on web development, although I am able to accomplish tasks that require a different skill-set (software development)

I've worked previously on a multitude of projects which can be found in here, in my github.

I am able to work in a time sensitive, stressful environment as-well as communicate to other project members effectively.
