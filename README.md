### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I program stuff. 
Pretty much anything from front end, to software or game development


#### Unpopular opinions
- Using Typescript over Javascript is always a preference for me when using Web related things.
- Using go for backends should be a standard.
- Using c# over java should be a standard
- Doing game cheating or similar should only be done in c++, not c# or some other stuff unless the game doesn't compile to asm.
- You shouldn't really use python for anything which isn't data related or machine learning.

#### About me
Im a programmer from britain. I primarily work with web related stuff but i know pretty much everything else. Im currently interested in game "cheating" and i have been doing things with it. I used to work for PSU and i made and developed some things which are being used in real world practice, for example their discord bot, or their api. I worked on their obfuscator although not as much as the other two where i build them from scratch. Im currently working on a backend for an undisclosed company. 

#### What I'm currently working on
As of writing, i am working on MoonSecV4 which is an obfuscator for Lua. [[Undisclosed]]
